# Homework #1: Vis Sketches

The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about visualization from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice sketching visualizations (by hand!)) and making a web page (programming in HTML and CSS).

You should first find a dataset online somewhere that you think is interesting. 

* You have to find an actual dataset - you can't create your own.
* Make sure the dataset's not too big, because you have to draw all of the data points in each your sketches.
* You have to have a minimum of 10 data points in your dataset.

Next, draw three visualizations of the dataset, by hand.

* By hand means using paper + pen, pencil, marker, etc. No computer based tools ()Photoshop, Figma, etc.) are allowed.
* You don't have to show *every* attribute of the dataset, but each sketch should show at least 3 of the same attributes.
* Your sketches have to be different types of visualizations (e.g., three scatter plots, each with a different color palette, does not count).
* Feel free to get creative with how you encode data - the goal is that you are *mapping* data values to visual representations. It's fine if your are using "oddball" or esoteric encodings for some of your charts!
* Try to make your sketches *accurate* in terms of encodings. For example, if you're using "the height of a rectangle" to represent some attribute, the heights should be accurate (or relatively accurate) based on each data point's value. Likewise, if you're using "color darkness (or lightness)" to indicate values, these should also be (relatively) accurate.

Take a picture of each chart and add it to the index.html page in this repository. (Make sure to include the images in your repository for submission!) Then, answer the questions below to describre the visualizations, and commit/push the updated page back to this repository to submit your assignment.

- At the top of the page, add your name and ASU email
- Replace the pictures of Sparky with photographs of your visualization sketches. Make sure they're clear/not blurry!
- Update the "Link to dataset" URL to point to the page where you found the dataset.

Next, replace the Lorem Ipsum text on the page accordingly:

- **Summary**: Provide a brief (~2-3 sentence) description of the dataset and the attributes your visualizing.
- **Sketch**: For each visualization, and in your own words (remember, ChatGPT and LLMs are NOT allowed in this class), describe the visualization's encodings (~2-3 sentences for each sketch). If you'd like, you can also tell me if you think this is a good and/or interesting visualization (and why or why not).
